# go run command compiles the program in a temp directory and runs the program file.

# package main - Known as a package declaration.
    	packages are go's way of organizing and reusing code.

#    Libaries are collections of code that are packaged together so that we can use them in programs.

#    import keyword is used to import packages to use with the program.

#    fmt package or "format" implements formating inputs and outputs.

#    The line that starts with // means it is a comment. comment are ignored by the go compiler.

#    comment can be single line // or multileine /* */

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello world!")
    }

#    Functions are building blocks of go programming language. they have inputs, outputs and a series of steps called statements which are executed in order.

#    All functions start with the keyword "func" followed ny the name of the function main()

#    fmt.Println("Hello world!")

    The statment is made up of three components:-
    1) We access another function inside the fmt package called Println i.e Print Line.
    2)We create a new string that contains the hello world
    3)We invoke (also call or execute) that function with the string as the first and only argument.

In summary
1)Start by declaring a package
2)Import a package such as the fmt package
3)create a function and to print on a new line, use te Println function in the fmt package

# finally we execute the  program with the "go run <program name>"

for more about Println, type;
