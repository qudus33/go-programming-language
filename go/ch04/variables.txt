Variable;
A variable is a storage location with a specific type and an associated name.

variables are first created by using the var keyword, then specifying the variable name e.g name and the data type e.g string then finally assigning a value to the variable Hello world

var name string = "Hello world"
fmt.Println(name)

var name string
name = "Abdulqudus"
fmt.Println(name)

var x string
x = "first "
x = x + "second" or x+= "second"

The symbol for equality is == 
var x string = "hello"
var y string = "world"
fmt.Println(x == y)

variables can be also be created this way;
name := "qudus"
x := 5
y := 10

Another way of writing a program is;
package main

import "fmt"

var x strint = "Hello world"
func main() {
    fmt.Println(x)
}

Constants;

Constants are basically variable whose values cannot be changed later.

use the "const" keyword

** Defining multiple variable
use the "var" or "const" keyword followed by parenthesis

var (
    a = 5
    b = 10
    c = 15
)

You can also read user input with scanf
